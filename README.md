# Orbital-Motion

This repo contains code for simulating motion of Moon around Earth and motion of Earth around Sun 
1. In earth&moon.py script, Moon revolves around Earth in circular orbit using Newtons's law of Gravitation and basic kinematics.
2. In earth&sun.py script, Earth revolves around Sun in elleptical orbit following Kepler's law of motion.
